# Columbia-Image-Classification

Image authentication is considerably a new stream of research. A formidable dataset for experimentation and evaluation of new methods is necessary for further progress in image authentication research. We will be prioritizing the Columbia Photographic Images and Photorealistic Computer Graphics dataset which is accessible to the image authentication research community. This dataset is obtained from http://www.ee.columbia.edu/trustfotoâ€‹ where it is a subset of data which is composed of 4 image sets namely, Photorealistic Computer Graphics Set, Personal Photographic Image Set, Google Image Set, and the Recaptured Computer Graphics Set. This report will consist of a method to extract information from the images using the required pixel Intensity (RGB colour spectrum)
